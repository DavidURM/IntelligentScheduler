#  Intelligent Task Scheduler (SRTF Web App)

A course project for **Intelligent User Interfaces**. This is a lightweight web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed to help users manage and visualize tasks using the **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** scheduling algorithm.

##  Overview

The app takes user input in the form of tasks with arrival and burst times, and then simulates SRTF scheduling to determine task execution order. It visually represents the scheduling result, allowing users to better understand how SRTF operates.

##  Features

-  Implements the SRTF scheduling algorithm in real-time.
-  User input form for task arrival and burst times.
-  Visual representation of task scheduling (like a Gantt chart).
-  Clear output with waiting and turnaround times.

##  Tech Stack

- **HTML** – Structure of the application
- **CSS** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript** – Logic for the SRTF algorithm and DOM manipulation

##  How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Add tasks by entering their arrival and burst times.
3. Click **"Schedule"** to see the results.
4. View the execution order and relevant metrics.

##  About SRTF

SRTF is a preemptive scheduling algorithm that always selects the process with the shortest remaining time to execute next. It's optimal in terms of average waiting time but may cause starvation for longer tasks.
